## Execute code
The program is executed by the following command
```sh
go run main.go -id=el1 -port=15237
```
- The `-port` flag is optional and will default to `15657` if it is left out.
- The program, when restarted must be started again with the same id in order to continue serving its orders network.
- Every elevator on the network must have it's own unique id.
